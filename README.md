# Decision Tree Visualization

## Overview

Machine Learning has great potential for improving products, processes and research. But computers usually do not 
explain their predictions which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. In this project we aim to increase
the interpretability of one such machine learning algorithm "Decision Tree". In order to accomplish this we visualize
the decision tree generated by the python library 'sklearn' using D3.js.
